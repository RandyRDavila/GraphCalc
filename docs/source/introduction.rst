Introduction
============

Welcome to `graphcalc`, a Python package designed for computing complex graph invariants such as the independence number, domination number, and more. `graphcalc` leverages mixed-integer programming (MIP) to provide exact solutions for these invariants, making it especially useful for researchers in graph theory, network science, and combinatorial optimization.

Key Features
------------

- Computes NP-hard graph invariants efficiently using MIP.
- Supports multiple invariants, including independence number, domination number, and vertex cover.
- Integrates easily with the `networkx` library, allowing for compatibility with its graph structures.

Who Should Use This Package
---------------------------

- **Researchers and Mathematicians**: For exploring graph properties and supporting conjecture generation.
- **Data Scientists and Network Analysts**: To gain insights into structural graph properties for applications like social networks or resource optimization.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for installing, using, and understanding the features of `graphcalc`.
