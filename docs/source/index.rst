GraphCalc Documentation
=======================

Welcome to GraphCalc, a Python package designed for computing complex graph
invariants on NetworkX graph objects. GraphCalc leverages mixed-integer programming (MIP) to
provide exact solutions for these invariants, making it especially useful for researchers
in graph theory, network science, and combinatorial optimization.
